# APIs.do - Driv.ly Workers framework

## Example

This example shows off the following features:
- Automatic API documentation
- Link generation
- Query parameter modification
- Query modification for multiple values (cities, zip codes, credit scores, etc.)

```js
import { API, json, requiresAuth, modifyQuery, modifyQueryMultiple, schemaGen } from 'apis.do'

const api = new API({
  name: 'domain.do',
  description: 'ðŸ¤– API'
}, {
  examples: {
    createVehicle: '/hello/0'
  }
})

api.get('/:hello/:worldNumber?', req => {
  return {
    links: {
      self: req.url,
      next: modifyQuery(req.url, { worldNumber: req.params.worldNumber + 1 }),
      'Create Plan By City': modifyQueryMultiple(req.url, 'zip', req.ctx.cities)
    },
    data: {
      hello: req.params.hello,
      worldNumber: req.params.worldNumber
    }
  }
})

export default {
  fetch: api.fetch
}
```
