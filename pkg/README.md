# APIs.do - Driv.ly Workers framework

## Important note:
If you dont link a CTX service worker, the API will default to fetching data from ctx.vin. This means that the IP address and CF-Ray-Id headers will be incorrect for the request. If you want to use the correct IP address and CF-Ray-Id headers, you must link a CTX service worker.

## Example

This example shows off the following features:
- Automatic API documentation
- Link generation
- Query parameter modification
- Query modification for multiple values (cities, zip codes, credit scores, etc.)

```js
import { API, json, requiresAuth, modifyQuery, modifyQueryMultiple, schemaGen } from 'apis.do'

const api = new API({
  name: 'domain.do',
  description: 'ðŸ¤– API'
}, {
  examples: {
    createVehicle: '/hello/0'
  }
})

api.get('/:hello/:worldNumber?', req => {
  return {
    links: {
      self: req.url,
      next: modifyQuery(req.url, { worldNumber: req.params.worldNumber + 1 }),
      'Create Plan By City': modifyQueryMultiple(req.url, 'zip', req.ctx.cities)
    },
    data: {
      hello: req.params.hello,
      worldNumber: req.params.worldNumber
    }
  }
}, {
  description: 'Hello world',
  parameters: {
    hello: 'string',
    worldNumber: 'number'
  },
  response: schemaGen({ hello: '', worldNumber: 0 })
})

export default {
  fetch: api.fetch
}
```

## Request properties
Most of the properties are self-explanatory, but here are some modifications to the request object provided by itty-router:

- request.user - The user object from ctx.vin
- request.ctx - The context object from ctx.vin
- request.waitUntil - The waitUntil function exposed by Cloudflare Workers
- request.params - The params object from itty-router
- request.query - The query object from itty-router
- request.body - The body object from itty-router
